# Automated Effect Expiration for DnD5e

## Description

This module introduces automatic expiration for Active Effects, similar to Times Up, but simpler.
You can configure whether expired effects are just disabled or permanently deleted.
Additionally you can specify special durations, like on the next turn of the caster for example.

## Features

-   Automatic Active Effect Expiration
-   Special Durations (for Spell Effects like Shield, the Reaction block from Arms of Hadar, etc.)

## Compatibilities

-   Effective Transferral
-   Visual Active Effects
-   and probably many others too

## Incompatibilities

-   Times Up
    -   Does the same
-   Dynamic Active Effects
    -   Small UI conflict but can still be used side by side
-   Midi-Qol
    -   Probably? I don't use it, like ever.
